# Comparative Classifier Test — OpenShift Job
#
# Runs the same 23 prompts through each classifier independently:
#   1. ClawRouter (fast-path regex, 15-dim heuristic)
#   2. vLLM Semantic Router (sentence embeddings, all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
#   3. Combined pipeline (fast-path → semantic fallback)
#
# The image at quay.io/cnuland/semantic-claw-router:latest is built
# with INSTALL_SEMANTIC=1, so sentence-transformers is available.
#
# Usage:
#   oc apply -f manifests/comparative-test-job.yaml
#   oc logs -f job/comparative-classifier-test
#
# JSON output (for downstream pipelines):
#   oc apply -f manifests/comparative-test-job.yaml
#   oc logs job/comparative-classifier-test | python -m json.tool
#
# Cleanup:
#   oc delete job comparative-classifier-test
